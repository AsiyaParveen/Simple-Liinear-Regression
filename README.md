## **Banana Softness Prediction – Simple ML + Flask Web App**

This project is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning web application that predicts the **softness of bananas** based on the number of **ripening days**.
It uses a **Simple Linear Regression model**, trained on a small real-world dataset (Days vs Softness), and provides predictions through a clean **Flask backend API** and a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JS UI**.

 **Key Features**

* Simple Linear Regression model (trained using scikit-learn)
* Model saved as `.pkl` for fast loading in real applications
* Flask API endpoint (`/predict`) for real-time predictions
* Responsive and user-friendly HTML/JS interface
* Input validation on both frontend and backend
* Perfect mini-project for beginners learning ML deployment

 **Tech Stack**

* Python, Flask
* Scikit-Learn
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Pickle (model serialization)

**What the App Does**
You simply enter the **number of ripening days**, and the app instantly predicts the **expected softness level** using the trained ML model.
